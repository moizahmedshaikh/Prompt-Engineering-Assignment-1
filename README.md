## 🧩 Key Learnings

- **AI Evolution:** From rule-based systems and expert programs to neural networks and transformer architectures.  
- **LLMs:** Generate human-like text by predicting tokens based on probabilities and massive datasets.  
- **Agentic AI:** Represents the next generation — where AI systems can reason, plan, and act autonomously.  
- **Limitations:** Hallucinations can’t be fully eliminated but can be minimized using **RAG** and **fine-tuning**.  
- **Business Impact:** Leaders need conceptual clarity to integrate **Generative AI** responsibly into organizations.

## 🧠 Conceptual Flow (Presentation Summary)

1. **Early Foundations (1940s–1950s):**  
   - Birth of computing & Turing Test.  
   - Symbolic reasoning and early logic-based AI.

2. **The Rise of Expert Systems (1970s–1980s):**  
   - Rule-based decision-making programs.  
   - Knowledge representation and inference engines.

3. **Machine Learning Era (1990s–2010):**  
   - Emergence of neural networks and data-driven learning.  
   - Breakthroughs in speech and image recognition.

4. **Deep Learning Revolution (2012–2019):**  
   - Rise of GPUs, backpropagation improvements, and massive data.  
   - Models like **AlexNet**, **BERT**, and **GPT-2** shaped modern AI.

5. **Generative & Agentic AI (2020–Present):**  
   - Transformer-based LLMs (GPT-3, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA).  
   - Emergence of **Agentic AI**, where systems can autonomously perform tasks and make reasoning-based decisions.

## 🧰 How LLMs Work

> **Large Language Models (LLMs)** predict the next token (word piece) in a sequence based on prior context.

### 🔍 Core Concepts:
- **Training:** On billions of text tokens using transformer architecture.  
- **Attention Mechanism:** Enables models to “focus” on relevant parts of the input.  
- **Fine-Tuning:** Customizes base models for domain-specific tasks.  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Adds external knowledge retrieval to improve accuracy and reduce hallucination.
